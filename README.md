## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, I'm Torof and this is my Github.

I love coding web apps using React but I'm also glad to dive into the backend or an API with NodeJS.
I'm a Blockchain developer, so smart-contracts or dapps would be my specialization.
I develop on both Ethereum an Solana
Programming is more of a passion than a job for me so I work hard and make things happen.

I speak ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· French, ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ English and ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Spanish.
