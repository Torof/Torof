# Torof

## 👋 Hello there!

I'm a Blockchain Developer specialized in smart contracts. I have extensive knowledge of the blockchain development standards around and I'm an expert in tokens (ERC20, NFTs). I perform security audits and have deep understanding of the EVM and opcodes. I'm also proficient in Solana development.

I can build complete fullstack DApps from scratch, write comprehensive tests, and implement data solutions with Graph & Subgraphs. Programming is more than just a job for me - it's a passion that drives me to work hard and make things happen.
