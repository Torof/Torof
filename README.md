## 👋 Hello there!

I'm a passionate Blockchain Developer specializing in smart contracts and dApps. I love building web applications with React, Nextjs and enjoy diving into backend development with NodeJS. Programming is more than just a job for me - it's a passion that drives me to work hard and make things happen.

I develop on both Ethereum and Solana ecosystems and am constantly exploring new blockchain technologies.
